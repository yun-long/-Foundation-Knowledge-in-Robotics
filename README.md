How does a robot move? How does a robot see? How does a robot learn?
How to represent a robot? How to control a robot? How to estimate the
state of a robot? How to design a robot? Too many questions, right?
This repository provides a collection of **Online Lectures** and **Lecture 
Notes**. The design principle of those notes is to be concise, clear, and
comprehensive, namely, **less is more**.
Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, this resource 
aims to lay a solid foundation in robotics.

If you find this repository helpful, you can **Star** it to show your support.

Stay tuned for more updates.

**Disclaimer**: The notes may contain errors.

### Acknowledgement 
We stand up on the shoulders of giants. I deeply appreciate 
the online lectures, books, and papers. I will provide a comprehensive list of 
references soon. I want to thank the open-source community, which provides
useful tools for note taking, such as Latex, NeoVim, and texpresso.
I use figures from the internet for illustration purposes. However, I lost 
track of the sources of the figures. I didn't put the references in the notes 
also for the sake of simplicity. If you find your figures in my notes and want 
to be credited, please let me know. 
Finally, thanks Jiaxu for suggesting the nvim plugin texpresso, it is extremely 
useful.
