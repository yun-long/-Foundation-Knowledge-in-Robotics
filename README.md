## Foundation of Robotics

As a self-taught robotics researcher, I have struggled to find the 
right resources to learn fundamental knowledge in robotics. This repository
is a collection of **Lecture Notes** I made while learning the foundation 
of robotics. I believe in the power of **learning by teaching** and **less is 
more**". Stay tuned for more updates. 

Disclaimer: The notes are not comprehensive and may contain errors.
