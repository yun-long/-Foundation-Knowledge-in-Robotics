## Foundation of Robotics

Being a self-taught robotics researcher, I have struggled a lot to find the 
right resources to learn fundamental knowledge in robotics. This repository
is a collection of **Lecture Note** that I made while learning the foundation 
of robotics. 

### Overview

Robotics Basics
  - Linear Algebra
  - Calculus
  - Convex Optimization

Robot Dynamics
  - Estimation
  - Recursive Estimation

Control
  - Control Theory
  - Optimal Control
  - Numerical Optimal Control

Learning
  - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
  - Deep Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning

Vision
  - Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics
  - Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Case Study
  - Flying Robots
  - Legged Robots
