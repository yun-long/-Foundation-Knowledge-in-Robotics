## Foundations of Robotics

How does a robot move? How does a robot see? How does a robot learn?
How to represent a robot? How to control a robot? How to estimate the
state of a robot? How to design a robot?
Too many questions, right?
As a self-taught robotics researcher, I have struggled to find the 
right resources to learn fundamental knowledge in robotics. This repository
is a collection of **Lecture Notes** I made. 
The design principle of those notes is to be concise, clear, and
comprehensive, namely, **less is more**.

Please let me know if you have interests by **Star** this repository. 

Stay tuned for more updates. 

Disclaimer: The notes are not comprehensive and may contain errors.
